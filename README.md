# ![](resources/anyshortcut/32x32.png) AnyShortcut

AnyShortcut is an AutodeskÂ® Fusion 360â„¢ add-in for easily assigning keyboard shortcuts to commands where it is not usually possible to assign a shortcut*. It also has some built-in commands for Fusion 360â„¢ commands that cannot easily be capture and run without some extra tweaking (e.g. *Look At Sketch*).

If you get any problems, please check out the section on [Fusion 360 quirks](#fusion-360-quirks).

## Built-in Commands

The built-in commands are always visible in the *AnyShortcut* menu. Assign shortcuts to them in the usual way.

Built-in commands include:

 * Look At Sketch
 * Look At Selected or Sketch
 * Activate (containing) Component
 * Move history marker backwards/forwards
 * View orientation
 * Repeat last command

## Recording

When enabled, the add-in records the resulting commands of actions that the user performs and collects them in the *AnyShortcut* menu. The commands in the menu can then be assigned shortcut keys in the regular way.

If not stopped, the recording stops automatically after a number of commands, to avoid any performance degradation when the user is not setting up shortcuts.

\* Not all actions in Fusion 360â„¢ result in "Commands" and some commands are not usable on their own. For example, *Pick Circle/Arc Tangent* does not generate a "Command" and *Roll History Marker Here* is triggered when clicking rewind in the history, but rewind actually first selects an item and then rolls.

### Usage

To set up a shortcut:

* Click *Start recording* and then perform the command you want to create a shortcut for
* If you are lucky, the command will now have appeared at the bottom of the *AnyShortcut* menu.
* Find the command in the menu and click the three dots to assign a shortcut as usual.

To remove a shortcut, follow the same procedure. Hint: You can press the shortcut to trigger the command to be run and make it appear in the recorder.

## Fusion 360 Quirks

Be aware of the following quirks in Fusion 360â„¢.

* Even though you've added a shortcut, it might not show up next time you restart Fusion 360â„¢. However, the shortcut still works and you see it if you open *Change Keyboard Shortcut*. (You can also verify using [KeyboardShortcutsSimple](https://github.com/thomasa88/KeyboardShortcutsSimple/blob/master/README.md))

* Fusion 360â„¢ cannot handle all key combinations. Forget Alt+Left to rollback history, because Fusion 360â„¢ cannot save this combination and it will be broken next time you start Fusion 360â„¢.

* Menu items in sub-menus are not always clickable ([bug](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/fusion-360-api-and-scripts/api-bug-cannot-click-menu-items-in-nested-dropdown/td-p/9669144)). However, you don't need to be able to click the commands to map a shortcut!

## Supported Platforms

  * Windows
  * Mac OS

## Installation

Download the add-in from the [Releases](https://github.com/thomasa88/AnyShortcut/releases) page.

Unpack it into `API\AddIns` (see [How to install an add-in or script in Fusion 360](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/fusion-360/troubleshooting/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/How-to-install-an-ADD-IN-and-Script-in-Fusion-360.html)).

Make sure the directory is named `AnyShortcut`, with no suffix.

The new menu *TOOLS* -> *ANYSHORTCUT* is now available.

The add-in can be temporarily disabled using the *Scripts and Add-ins* dialog. Press *Shift+S* in Fusion 360â„¢ and go to the *Add-Ins* tab.

## Ideas for commands to map

Here is a table of some commands that can be interesting to map.

| Command                     | Notes                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Rename, in the timeline     | Let's you select an item in the timeline and press F2 to rename it. I have not found any way to do this in the browser. |
| Look at (bottom toolbar)    | Select a face and orient the view normal to it. I have not found any way to tell it to "Look at" the current. |
| Isolate                     |                                                              |
| Find in Browser             |                                                              |
| Find in Window              |                                                              |
| Activate Component          | Works in the Browser and in the 3D space, but you must have selected a component in 3D space, not a body or a face. |
| Remove                      | Opposed to *Delete,* *Remove* appears as a timeline feature. |
| Simulate or other workspace | Easily switch to a workspace.                                |
